### Whispering Petals

A beginner project exploring HTML structure, CSS styling, and responsive design.I developed the Whispering Petals website as a creative exploration of color, inspired by the healing and uplifting qualities of nature. The intention was to create a harmonious, cheerful, and positive online space.
## What I Learned:
**HTML & CSS:** I strengthened my understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling, including layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid.
**Responsive Design:** I implemented responsive design to ensure the website works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
**User Experience (UX):** I learned how important color schemes, typography, and layout are in creating a pleasant and intuitive user experience.
**Project Structure:** I learned to organize files and assets in a scalable and clean structure, which helped keep the project manageable.
**Version Control:** I practiced using Git for version control, which made tracking changes and managing the project much easier.
## Challenges Faced:
**Styling Consistency:** Initially, it was difficult to maintain consistent styling. I overcame this by using a centralized CSS file and reusable components.
**Image Optimization:** Using high-quality images without slowing down the site was tricky. I learned how to optimize images and use appropriate formats.
**Responsiveness:** Making the layout adapt across different screen sizes took time and required multiple iterations.
During the development process, I encountered errors and bugs related to audio functionality on the website. I resolved these issues by consulting Google and the aforementioned websites. Additionally, I plan to further enhance the project by integrating features such as petal animations, music interactions. 
## Improvements for the Future: 
**Add Functionality:** I would like to add features like a shopping cart, blog section, or a contact form with backend integration.
**Accessibility:** Improve accessibility features like alt text for images, keyboard navigation.
**Navigation:** Linking the navigation bar with different sections of the website.
This project gave me practical experience in web development and helped build my confidence in turning ideas into a functional, aesthetic website. Iâ€™m proud of the final result and excited to continue improving my web development skills.

The external sources I utilized include YouTube videos, Codependent, W3Schools, MDN, and various educational resources from Tech Educators and my teachers.
